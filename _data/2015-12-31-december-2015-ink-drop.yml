      The December 2015 Ink Drop brought five more colours to the fore.

      These colours are clearly selected with the Christmas holiday
      season in mind, with such names as "Myrrh", "Frankencense",
      "Gold", and the two tagalong colours for Christmas of "Vibrant
      Green" and "Bright Red".

      It is a pretty set, and they all display well with the glass
      pen. Less so with the Q-tip swab, but I blame that more on the
      swab and the swabber.

      I cannot seem to keep the correct spelling for De Atramentis in
      my head, so there are some creative spellings in the list.

      I like this green, it's quite pretty. I would not say so much
      vibrant from the swab, but from the glass pen, really nice.

      The D.A. gold is pretty nice, too. I like the colour from the pen.

      So this blue is nice. "Myrrh" is one of those things most of us
      go "what the heck is myrrh anyway" so the blue is somewhat of a
      pleasant surprise. I had no expectations, but I do like it.

      Like the D.A. Gold, it's very nice colour from the pen. It bears
      a good test on real fountain pen quality paper.

      Pelikan's Bright Red is definitely bright. In the swab test it
      comes out rather coral in colour, but with the glass pen and on
      the S-B paper below, it's a very nice bright ink colour.

      I think this colour was even more surprising than the Myrrh, and
      Frankincense also has the mysterious "what the heck is it?"
      quality about it. The shade in the swab feels a deeper grey than
      some others, while the glass pen gives a nice enough black.

      I was not too happy with the swabs of ink on the standard 3x5
      cards, so I decided to give them a go on my favourite sketchbook
      from Stillman & Birn, with their Beta paper.

      The results were much more saturated and vibrant, and I gave
      them a much better amount of ink. They are quite lovely.
