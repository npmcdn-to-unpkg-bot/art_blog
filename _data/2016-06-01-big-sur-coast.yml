      Just started by painting in the water along the coast line. The
      ridges in the coast line are drawn in, along with heavy marks
      where the posts for the foreground will go. I drew them extra
      heavy so as not to lose them in subsequent washes.

      I knew I wanted the foreground to have a bright glow, so I painted it in with Quin Gold.

      I put in the sky but wasn't thinking too clearly about it. Big
      Sur has basically two kinds of sky at the coast: fogged in, and
      bright clear blue. This was not so much a west coast sky.

      I brightened up the sky a lot using Phthalo Blue with some
      Cobalt Blue. This won't be the last time I touch the sky...

      Painting in the near midground and one of the far midground
      strips. The midground was done in "ribbons" so as to give the
      ridges their own feeling. The hillside was covered alternately
      with grass and a purple ground covering. (I could not tell quite
      what it was.)

      The background also got an underpainting of very, very pale Andy's Green.

      Finished filling in the other midground "ribbons" and added a
      bit more detail to the background. Not much, and keeping it pale
      so it will recede into the distance.

      Back to the sky, I wanted it to really come out bright, so more
      Phthalo Blue and Cobalt Blue applied, more pigment.

      The rear midground had many trees covering it, so I stippled
      them in with very pigmented Andy's Green.

      close up detail for the foreground and midground

      The effect of grasses is done using the edge of a palette knife
      and quickly scraping into the slightly wet (not overly wet)
      paint and paper, basically gouging it out.

      Painted in the posts (still wet in the picture). As they are silhouettes against the brighter background, they are mostly chromatic black, with also some Quin Burnt Orange on their left sides, also very deep pigment, and blended.

      After waiting for the posts to dry, I painted in the barbed wire.

      Using a mixture of zinc white gouache and raw sienna, I painted the much brighter tops of the posts that were catching the sunlight, and added a few details on the posts for interest.

      Using that mixture, and some aureolin and gouache, I added more tufts of grass.
