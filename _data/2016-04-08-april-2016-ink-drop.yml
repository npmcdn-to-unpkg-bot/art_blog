      The penultimate ink drop, April 2016, is entitled "Forest
      Foray". It's a set of 3 greens and two browns, three from
      Diamine, and one each from Noodler's and Platinum.

      It's a really nice set of colours, perhaps more suited to
      painting than inking, and so I did a little picture with the
      inks to just try them out.

      This is a rather magical ink -- there is a really nice shimmer
      that I did not notice until after it had dried down a bit. It's
      rather pretty and *very* green -- it reminds me just a little of
      Phthalo Green / Winsor Green watercolour paint.

      A nice middle green, very nice looking.

      The noodler's forest green is a really rich deep green, I really
      love the look of this one.

      This terracotta is a lucious brown colour that definitely looks
      like terracotta pots. It's a very pretty brown and looks really
      good next to the greens.

      I wasn't at all sure what the "mix-free" refers to, but I found
      this on
      [PenChalet](https://www.penchalet.com/ink_refills/fountain_pen_ink/platinum_mixable_fountain_pen_ink.html)

      > <small>Mix your own ink colors with the Platinum Mixable Mix-Free
        fountain pen ink. This unique ink system allows you to mix and
        create the colors you want. Choose from multiple colors and
        follow the chart below to create even more great fountain pen
        ink colors or get creative and mix any color combination you
        want.</small>


      > <small>Using the power of chemistry and a little creativity you can

        is possible. Combine any of the colors or multiple colors to
        achieve a rainbow or color options. Purchase two colors or all
        nine for endless possibilities.</small>

      So, I guess it's for mixing. Seems like a better term would have
      been "mixable" but I'm not in marketing.

      It's an nice brown, but does not have the richness of the Terracotta.

      A little test "painting" in ink, using all the greens, and the
      terracotta.

      S&B beta sketchbook, using the waterbrush to lay down some wet
      areas for the trunks first, then mixing in the greens above for
      the leaves, and dry from the glass pen for the foreground.

      Not really stunning, rather crude composition. Meh.
