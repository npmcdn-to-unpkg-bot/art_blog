    description: |2+

      I glazed over the open area on the left, under the woods and
      next to the large tree on the left in order to give the area a
      bit of a glow. The space was looking a bit too dull, and I
      wanted to lift it up a bit before giving it it's final colour.

    caption: Figures With Path Defined
    description: |2+

      After the quin gold glazing was dry, I gave the left side meadow
      it's final colour, a muted green, in order to define the path
      the figures are walking along.

      I filled in the colour on the figures as well. I didn't want
      them to much more than gestures, not a lot of details,
      really. The dog was pretty hard, actually, since it's walking
      away from the viewer, all you really have to work with is dog
      butt. It took me about 4 or 5 tries, at one point it just looked
      more like a leopard than anything else. This is the best I could
      do for now.

      Photo closeup of the figures in a vertical setting.

      In the last three, I was just trying to see what some different
      crops might look like. This one is actually not bad.

      I added some highlights to the figures with white goauche. I
      don't know if it helped any with the dog. It still looks more
      like a big fluffy cat than a dog.

      I stepped further away from the painting to take the picture
      with a flash and then cropped the result down to this.

      Straightened and cropped the previous image, closer in. I liked
      the lighting of this one better than the one with the flash from
      a distance.

      Adding a photoshop mat to the last image. This one isn't
      actually the final, I think it needs some shadows anchoring the
      figures before it's done. I just wanted to find a colour for the
      mat.

      Gave the two figures some light shadows to stand upon, anchoring them
      to the ground.

      Deepened the shadows a bit more, adding in French Ultramarine.

      Using zinc white gouache, I added some streaks to the trees, to
      lighten them a touch, and provide some depth and interest in them.

      I'm calling it done. As the border areas are so dark, I signed it with white pencil at the suggestion of my teacher.
