      With the source image behind, I started with the sky. Putting
      the paper upside-down, I used washes of aureolin, permanent
      alizerin crimson, and french ultramarine, leaving the disc of
      the sun paper white.

      Flipping the block back upright, I then painted in the water
      capturing the sky's reflection and deepening into the blue water
      closer to the viewer.

    caption: Deepening the Water
    description: |2+

      I painted a second layer on the water area to deepen the
      hues. For some odd reason, the blue water layer refused to
      darken the way I wanted it to here.

    caption: Darken Water

      I *really* darkened the water, using less water on the brush,
      making sure my paint was well-mixed. I think it worked this
      time.

      This is after the deeper blue application of paint dried. I
      spent a lot of time on this painting waiting for things to dry!

    caption: Beach Trees Turtles
    description: |2+

      This is now 2 weeks later, and I've put in the far beach with
      it's trees, and put in the turtuels. I initially used a putty
      knife to scrape the water ripples into the tree trunks. I
      scraped the fuzzy palm leaves with the angled back end of one of
      my paint brushes.

      The sun's edge was softened a bit.

      The turtles were painted using phthalo green, keeping it fairly
      lightly tinted so not to overpower things.

      Finally, I applied some white inktense pencil to give the water
      more of a ripply effect.

      This is the final version, all paint dry, all touch-ups
      done. I'm really enjoying this one, wishing I were there seeing
      it live.
