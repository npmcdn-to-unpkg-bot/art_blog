      The picture is a rather somber one, so I put in the sky holding
      the 1 inch flat upright so the brush struck with the narrow
      edge, giving the clouds some shape.

      The water went in with the flat as well, but heavier, and more
      of a wash, with some heavier strokes to give it some interest.

      The far shore was mainly some dense trees, very little going on
      there, so I put it in rather faded, to give it some distance.

      The yellow part on the lower left is to give the blossoms from
      the original picture their colour. It is impossibly to paint
      transparent yellow watercolour over a dark background, so I
      painted it on first.

      The last bit this session was getting the trees on the left side
      and the foreground area that is "by the lake" in. I'm very
      unhappy with the state the trees are in; that area is all
      muddy. I put it up and am leaving it until next week.

      One of the fascinating parts of this was using the mixture of
      Monte Amiato and Payne's Grey to make the green. It is a much
      darker green than expected, but seems quite perfect for this
      piece. I just need to keep from touching the painting with too
      much water, and wait for it to dry adequately.
