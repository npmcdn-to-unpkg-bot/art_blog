      The picture is a rather somber one, so I put in the sky holding
      the 1 inch flat upright so the brush struck with the narrow
      edge, giving the clouds some shape.

      The water went in with the flat as well, but heavier, and more
      of a wash, with some heavier strokes to give it some interest.

    caption: Far shore, and bright yellow underpaint
    description: |

      The far shore was mainly some dense trees, very little going on
      there, so I put it in rather faded, to give it some distance.

      The yellow part on the lower left is to give the blossoms from
      the original picture their colour. It is impossibly to paint
      transparent yellow watercolour over a dark background, so I
      painted it on first.

    caption: Foreground and overhanging branches

      The last bit this session was getting the trees on the left side
      and the foreground area that is "by the lake" in. I'm very
      unhappy with the state the trees are in; that area is all
      muddy. I put it up and am leaving it until next week.

      One of the fascinating parts of this was using the mixture of
      Monte Amiato and Payne's Grey to make the green. It is a much
      darker green than expected, but seems quite perfect for this
      piece. I just need to keep from touching the painting with too
      much water, and wait for it to dry adequately.

      Starting in from last week, I set to in the trees and bushes on
      the left side of the image with some fresh paint.

      Mixing the Monte Amiato and Payne's Grey, I was never getting it
      to the lightness I wanted, it never really got above a drab,
      olive or dead spinach colour. It is definitely better than I
      left it, as you can see in the comparison in the next image, but
      still not great.

      Leaving that for a while, I worked on the overhanging branches,
      giving more of them, and bringing them down further into the
      picture, which I think gives it a bit more balance.

      Showing the end of last week with the initial work this week,
      there is definitely a difference going on. It's still not
      pleasing me.

    caption: Remove paint to open up trees and foreground
    description: |

      At the teacher's suggestion, I set to remove paint.  After
      removing a bit of paint overall in the trees, I remove several
      small triangles. Using the magic eraser, it's fairly easy
      to remove sections and small areas by taping out the space, then
      using the wet eraser.

      I removed almost all the foreground paint that would come off as
      well. The very foreground area needs to be brighter to give the
      painting depth. The plan for next session is to lay down a base
      of Quin Gold, then lay the green over that and put back the
      details.

      It may look like there wasn't any progress, but I am actually
      feeling good about the direction this is going.
