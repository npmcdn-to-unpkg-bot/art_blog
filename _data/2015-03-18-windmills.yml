      A very tiny image to start with, I blew it up a lot on the
      copier. Honestly, what you see in the thumbnail is about the
      actual size!

      There really isn't much to this picture, mostly the middle
      tones of the land and the windmills. The darkest parts are the
      vanes and the roofs.

      I love doing sky. This is cobalt blue.

      The base colours for the sky and ground in, I decided to go
      bright red for the mills.

      The paint is
      still *very* wet.

      Same level of work above, but this time the paint is dry.

      I love the richness of the tones here in the red. I used a
      mixture of permanent rose and quin burnt orange.

        This is basically how I want the colours to work, and the
        various elements, when I do the full size painting next
        week. I am loving this.

      After tracing out the shapes in a photo blue pencil, I put in
      the sky using cobalt blue with a 1 inch flat brush. I love
      using this brush for washes, it holds a *ton* of water. The
      water in the canal was next, using french ultramarine blue,
      also with the 1 inch flat.

      When the sky and water were (mostly) dry, I put in the grassy
      areas in the foreground and the middle area where the
      windmills are sitting. The base wash in each case was a
      mixture of sap green and aureolin (cobalt yellow). In the
      foreground I gave a little more depth with some phthalo green
      and quin burnt orange.

      The windmills hold the most interest, and the most colour, so
      I gave them a saturated red mixture of permanent alizerin
      crimson and quin burnt scarlett. I also wanted to show
      distance so the saturation trails off towards the right for
      the further windmills.

      "Giving the windmills a sunny side"

      After waiting for everything to dry, I wanted to provide some
      clues as to where the sun was coming from.
      To my mind, the sun is coming from behind the mills on their
      left, so to given them a bit more 3-dimensionality, I put a
      bright refelction on their left side using white goache,
      applied heavily at first and tapering off.

      After waiting for everything to dry again, I put in the very
      darkest parts of the painting and some details on the
      mills. The roofs of the mills, the lines, the windows, the
      doors, are all in a chromatic black made of french ultramarine
      blue and quin burnt orange, using a \#4 round brush. Also,
      using the same chromatic black I put in the shadowy darker
      side of the mill towers, feathering it out to the left, again
      to give depth and 3 dimensionality.

      This is the final step in the painting, where I added the wind
      vanes which in the source photo were all in the same
      configuration - assuming these were all locked down. I like
      the symmetry this gives the painting as well. Further details
      included a couple of docks in the first two, shadows and
      reflections of the mills in the canal, and a dock on the near
      side.

      This is the final version of the painting, along with both the
      value study and the colour thumbnail.

      Final version of the full-size painting, straightened up and cropped in Photoshop.

      I like this version, and
      will be entering it in this year's state fair.
