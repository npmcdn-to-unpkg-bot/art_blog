      The background is a stream or lake, not sure which, but it's
      intended to be a little active but still reflective.

      Kept it light to help make the bird pop, later.

      The heron is standing on the shore, it looks like. It's legs
      seem rather short, but perhaps this is a shorter-legged

      The throat in the photo was darker than this, but I'm rather
      liking this colour.
