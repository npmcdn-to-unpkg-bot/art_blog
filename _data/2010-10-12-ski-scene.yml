      This was actually the second version of this painting, but it
      sort of ended up worse, mainly because of mishandling, bad water
      control, and just not working out.

      It was put upright while still partially wet, so the streaked
      down. There are also large blooms of backwash, which might not
      be too bad if I'd worked it, but probably just ran out of time.

      Still, I like this, it isn't good enough to present, but for my
      second painting in class, not so bad.

      This is the second actual painting I did in class. Prior to
      this we had done a colour wheel, practicing strokes, washes,
      tinting and shading and the like, as well as the lake scene.

      We didn't really have much to follow, the teacher just told us
      to do. It was pretty fun to see something like this unfold on
      the paper. I had done watercolour off and on before, but never
      anything so directed at actually producing something.

      Inadvertently, I followed the much later advice given by a
      friend who is also and artist and an art teacher: No more than
      three things -- 3 skiers!

      And a black mat.

      Not sure which I prefer, if either.
