      Painting in the sillouhetted background with a very pale QBO wash.

      Filled in the very black portion of the head and ears with a chromatic black made of Fr.Ultra and QBO.

      I filled in the rest of the portrait, I think rather well, as I am not really good at figures.

      I really like this guy.
