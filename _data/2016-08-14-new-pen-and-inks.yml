      I recently received a package from
      [Goulet Pens](http://gouletpens.com)
      with a Konrad Ebonite pen and 3 inks.

          I forget why I was initially drawn to the Konrad Ebonite,
          perhaps because I wanted to try an ebonite pen. It was Brian
          Goulet's video review, though, that put it in my cart. I'm
          happy I bought it, it will easily become an EDC for me.

          The Konrad Ebonite is really a nice pen to write with, even
          without the flex. It has an awesome feel in the hand for me,
          not as smooth as acrylic, but a little grippy. It's warm and
          smooth, but never sticky.

          The problem I noticed when working with flexing the pen is
          that the ink flow doesn't keep up with how fast I'm
          writing. This isn't a big problem as it just requires me to
          slow down a bit. It's also possible this is a problem with
          the ink in this pen, which is the Diamine Oxblood reviewed
          later. Perhaps a really slippery ink would perform a lot
          better.

          Even so, with that railroading, one can get an interesting
          effect if one really wants to.

          This version, the "Methuselah's Pine Cone Ripple", in
          addition to being a rather cute name, is rather
          pretty. Brown isn't really one of those colours I'm drawn
          to, but I rather do like this one.

          The overall performance of the Konrad Flex I rather
          like. Unlike my experience with Noodler's Ahab Flex, I found
          the Konrad likeable and usable straight out of the box.

          Everyone seems to love this ink, it gets really high
          marks. I have tried some others, but never this one, so I
          thought I should give it a go.

          This is a quite lovely colour, really a rich yellow, with
          some great shading.

          Probably not suitable as an everyday ink, but it should
          belong in a kit for drawing and sketching, I feel.

          The orange retro pop gives it a really swell carry, and the
          1.1 mm stub nib produces a pretty good flow with this ink.

          I wanted to find out how it did in a more heavy application,
          so I used a Q-tip to apply a healthy amount, and then waited
          a bit for it to try, and applied some more in the lower
          half. This produced some really excellent shading.

        description: |2+

          Next I tried it with some water, putting the Q-tip full of
          ink down first, then using a water brush with just water,
          pulled th eink out of the ink. This worked pretty well,
          giving a nice gradation of shade.

          The sad part after that was that I attempted to squirt a
          tiny left-over bit of ink from a syringe, but the syringe
          was still dirty with some prior black ink :(

          On the plus side, the Apache Sunset did a pretty good job of
          blending with that ink as it dried down. :)

          Noodler's usually has nice images for their bottles, this is
          no exception.

          There is a discomfort with the appropriation here, however.

          I've been attracted to this ink for both it's colour and the
          name. I'm not at all sure what the name means, but it's
          definitely cute.

          And the colour *is* quite lovely.

          *Update:* This youtube video provides a great introduction
          and explanation about the ink: [https://youtu.be/SUczPSBbxdA](https://youtu.be/SUczPSBbxdA)

          Putting the ink the Grey Pilot Metropolitan, with a 1.1 mm
          stub, gives this ink a great carry and delivery. The flow is
          exquisite if a touch wet, but it goes on smoothly with this
          nib with absolutely no starting or skipping problems.

          I *love* this colour.

          This is the sort of ink that someone could make into their
          "signature" ink. It has a lot of distinction.

          The ink doesn't shade especially well, one has to resort to
          hatching to make a huge difference. It starts out pretty
          dark as well, so probably not a good choice.

          The ink dried too fast to get a good sense with water in the
          initial test here. I don't know how it would work in more
          applied session, but my initial feeling is that it is not
          going to perform easily.

          In trying to place the ink in a pre-wet patch on the paper
          also doesn't quite produce the results I'd like.

          This is possibly an artifact of the paper used. This is the
          Leuchtturm 1917 sketch book, which I have not tried much
          with water media. It might produce something much more
          likeable on the S-B Beta paper.

          Finally, the bottle image on this ink is really pretty, and
          a bit goofy as well, with the swan talking about eating
          yabbies (aussie shrimp).

          This is a fascinating ink; I've tried other red-black inks,
          but this one is a gem. I picked this one after seeing
          another Goulet video demonstrating a pen using this ink.

          Here again is the Konrad Flex Ebonite carrying the
          Oxblood. As said above, the pen, and this ink, are becoming
          one of my EDCs.

          This is a great ink, red and dark, perfect for writing your
          mysterious missives, in your grimoire, those epic
          manifestos and screeds against your enemies.

          It is really pretty on the page, I like this ink a lot.

          This is a sketching shading example, but the ink doesn't
          work so well in this way. It really requires hatching to
          make a difference.

          Here in the water flow tests, the ink really dried so fast I
          wasn't able to pull any into the water.

          Scratching ink from Q-tip into the wet area did some
          intersting things, however. The splatter from the syringe
          was nice as well.

          The classic Diamine bottle, the ink name is on the
