      Just the basic underpainting, a very pale Andy's Green. I'm not
      trying to keep it uniform in texture here, allowing backwashes
      and strokes and so on, since it will be the background
      underpainting I want there to be some variation going on.

      Taking some of the background areas very dark, again with a much
      more pigment saturated Andy's Green.

      stamens in the middle of the flower.

      Working on the first petal, this is the ultimate coolest thing
      about watercolour -- how the paint just flows! I wish I had a
      movie camera to show what's happening here.

      I started with a really saturated, almost dry line of Permanent
      Rose, Permanent Alizerin Crimson, and a touch of Phthalo Green
      (which drive this to purple!) along the right edge of the
      petal.

      THen I worked plain water from the left edge of the petal until
      it touched the paint, and wow did it flow!

      THe top petal was rather pale in the photo, so I tried to keep
      it that way. Started with a much lighter shade of the same
      P. Rose, P. Al. Crimson, and Phth. Green, and brought the plain
      water wash in to the paint. This required a bit more coercing, though.

      I've got most of the petals done here, at least a first
      approximation.

      Pointing out the difference between the upper petal in this
      image and the previous image -- I erased the light line in the
      previous and softened the edges.

      I removed the masking fluid, since you don't want to leave it on
      too long, and I didn't think I was going to need it any more. (I
      was wrong.)

      The froggie's body was pretty bright, and I wanted to emphasize
      it in the painting as well.

      I filled in the details on the frog, including it's eye and
      surround and some body markings.

      I painted in the basic stamen structure, although it still looks
      pretty flat.

      My teacher suggested I give the right petal that the frog is on
      more pink, and make the frog pop off the page.

      Sadly, this is where things started to go a bit wrong. I
      *thought* the stamens were dry, but they were not, and so the
      pink paint got soaked up into them. I thought I could fix it
      with some additional New Gamboge, but no.

      In for a penny...

      I went further and added more and deeper pink to the upper petal
      as well, and completed my ruination of the stamens.

    description: |2+

      Heroically, I masked off the stamens with masking tape cut into
      various curves and shapes, and then used the Magic Eraser to
      remove the paint from the stamens. I think it turned out pretty
      well. I feel lucky.
