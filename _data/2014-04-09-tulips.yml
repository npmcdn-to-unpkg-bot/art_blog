      Just painting some swirls, trying to get loose.

      There's a really nasty shadow on this.

      Painting some tulips, not really very representational. I completely forget why we were doing this in class. I don't think I was really into it much.

      That nasty shadow is a little less here, but still nasty.

      Tulips painting cleaned, straightened, leveled, and all that in Photoshop. No more nasty shadow.
