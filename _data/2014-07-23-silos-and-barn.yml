      The vegetation created a negative space around the buildings,
      that will give the buildings definition.

      Start in on shading the side of the barn. The light is coming
      from behind and to the right of the subjects. It's bright,
      direct light, and creates sharp defined shadows.

      The shading needs to be deepest for the silos at the left edge
      and taper towards the center, giving the round silo it's essence.

      Give some the smaller pipes some better shape and letting them
      stick out from the buildings better.

      One of the neat characteristics of the silos, in particular, is
      the rust on the buildings, and the character that adds to them.

      The windows had some interesting details happening. I had
      painted in the glass area in yellow originally, to give an
      underpainting for them, which will glow through the window
      details.

      The sign got painted in as well, just leaving a bit of
      "calligraphy" untouched.
