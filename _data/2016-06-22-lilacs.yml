      My initial sense of the image was the smallish lilac leaves in
      the various colours around the light purpole and pink.

      I played with the pigments on a test piece of paper, mixing the
      cobalt violet with the p.rose and p.alizerin crimson, and a
      little of the cobalt blue to get various shades I liked.

      On the painting, I tried stipling in the petals using different
      mixtures, sometimes mixing in the palette and sometimes directly
      on the paper. I like the way they came out.

      I put the background in using a bit of raw sienna,
      painting around the flowers, and mixing a little purple with the
      raw sienna on the table top.

    description: |2+

      The table rim is French Ultramarine blue. Additionally, I've
      added more mid-toneal values to the flowers. I also worked to
      reduce the vertical symmetry of the flower arrangement (it
      looked a bit too much like the Canadian flag done in purples).

      The painting felt too 2-dimensional. My teacher asked if I was
      brave enough to take out some of the paint, so I removed a swash
      from the front in a somewhat diagonal stroke. I put this away
      for a week.

      Picking up the painting from the previous week, I put in the
      forward spray of flowers, again using the stipling approach. It
      definitely has already a more 3D look.

      This was rather fun. The image had a lot of high lights on the
      top of the flowers from the overhead light, and I added the
      gouache to the tops of the sprays of lilac. It gave it even more
      of a 3D feeling.

      Again, using the white gouache, I added some spectral highlights
      to the vase. I also added a shadow from the flowers on the table
      top to bring out the vase more.

    description: |2+

      During a point while I was waiting for the slow version to dry,
      I decided to do another take on the painting as I was feeling
      restless.

      Doing this really fast and loose light value wash took less than
      5 minutes.

      After the light values dried, I then got in the middle and
      darker values. Total time to this point was 10 minutes.

      I was set to leave the 10 minute painting as is, but then it
      started to appeal to me, and I spent more time on other aspects.

      I added the table top and the wallpaper lines in the background.

      The teacher thought the lines were too dark, and so I lightened
      them a bit.

      As with the slow painting, I applied some gouache to the tops of
      the flower sprays and to the vase.

      The teacher thought the blue lines were still too dark, pulling
      from the rest of the painting. She suggested I paint the wall a
      shade of blue as well. I wanted to save the present state, so
      this is the "before" picture.

      This is the "after" picture, with the wall painted a light blue
      shade. It is better.

      This is the side-by-side comparison of the slow painting on the
      left, vs. the 10-minute painting on the right.
