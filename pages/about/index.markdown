This is [my] Art blog, which has been an idea floating around for
awhile, but I thought it was time to actually jump in on this and do
it.

I've been studying watercolour painting for the past several years,
starting in 2010, as a serious hobby and creative pursuit. I've been
sketching and drawing for years, and have dabbled in watercolour here
and there, but this has been the first formal painting training I've
done.

I'm enjoying myself tremendously, and am deeply indebted to my
teacher, Linda Stout, for being so willing, kind, and able to provide
me with a tiny glimmer of knowledge and skill in the area.

Most of my work has been showing on [DeviantArt] and Facebook, with
occasional appearance on my
[other blogs](http://blog.tamouse.org/categories/art/). *This* blog is
dedicated solely to my artistic endeavours.

## My Media

Watercolour is my primary pursuit right now. In the past I've also
done:

* Photography
* Drawing and sketching
* Digital art (Corel Painter, Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.)
* Music (bass, piano, guitar, harmonica, misc percussion, tin
  whistles).

I likely won't be saying anything about music, as I'm not sure
anything I'm doing, or will do, is going to be interesting on a
blog. But we'll see.

## Commissions

If you're interested in having me do a piece for you, contact me at
<tamouse@gmail.com> or at the various other places you might find me.

## Sales

I'm not much into sales. Still some people have expressed interest in
getting something of mine. I have a few places you can buy things.

* [Redbubble] (prints, cards, cups, ipod thingies, t-shirts, stickers, stuff)
* [Zazzle] (a whole rack of things)
* [Etsy] (postcards and greeting cards only, and sometimes I offer up orginals)
* [DeviantArt] (prints, cards, stuff)

If you want to buy something great. It won't hurt my feelings if you
don't.

Most of my work has been class-oriented and copies of other artists'
work, so is not appropriate for sales, shows, and so on.
