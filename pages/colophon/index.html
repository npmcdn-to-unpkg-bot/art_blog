## Organizing, Storing, and Viewing Images

Art work is stored in a directory tree under `$HOME/Art/`.

I've adopted the standard that images in the root of a directory are
the things that should be shown. Thus
`watercolour/class/2015/2015-03-windmills/` will have the images
that should be shown.

I have also created a utility, `$HOME/bin/makegallery.rb` (ruby
script), that builds differently-sized images suitable for regular
web browsing, a smaller "gallery" size, and a square thumb nail
size.

Files and folders that I do *not* want uploaded to S3 are saved in
directories with an underscore prefix which is ignored by the sync
script mentioned [below](#automating-file-upload).

Images that are used in the art blog are stored out on Amazon S3
with publicly-accessible links. The bucket is `s3://art.tamouse.org/`
and the directory path for the images should exactly match the
directory path on the hard drive here under the `$HOME/Art/` folder.

Thus, something in `$HOME/Art/Gallery/my-awsome-painting.jpg` will
correspond to `s3://art.tamouse.org/Gallery/my-awesome-painting.jpg`
and have the public URL of
`http://art.tamouse.org.s3.amazonaws.com/Gallery/my-awesome-painting.jpg`.

This makes writing blog posts containing images fairly easy,
by setting the `page.gallery.path` to the path for the images, and
have the collection of images as file names.

### Automating file upload

The script `$HOME/Art/syncs3.sh` performs the synchronozation of the
image files, excluding files and directories that match the regular
expressions contained in `$HOME/Art/.rexclude_from`. Presently, only
directories which are actually used in the art blog are sync'd.

### Automating blog post creation

Initially creating a blog post that refers to a particular directory
in the Art directory tree is something I want to automate.

### Page gallery infomation in blog posts

Information about the images is kept in the post's front matter
section, under the tag `gallery`.

The directory path to the images is in the `path` subcomponent of
`gallery`.

The images are listed in the `images` array. Each image is expected to
have the following subcomponents:

* `fullsize` - the filename of the image
* `gallery` - path to the gallery-size image
* `web` - path to the web-size image
* `thumb` - path to the thumb-nail-size image
* `caption` - a one-line text description
* `description` - a longer text description, which will be run through
markdown

By default, using the `makegallery.rb` script, the subdirectories are:

* `gallery`: `gallery/`
* `web`: `webs/`
* `thumb`: `thumbs/`

Also, by default, the extension on the images in the `thumbs/`
subdirectory is `gif`.
