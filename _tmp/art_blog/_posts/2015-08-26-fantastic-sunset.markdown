      The original source photo shows a very colourful sunset with
      strong highlights in the clouds above.

      Converting the source photo to its essential values, shows the
      deepest parts are the foreground and the middle strip of land,
      along with the tree.

      Some of the cloud layer is in the middle tones, as is some of
      the water reflecting the sky.

      I used photoshop to pull these out into a monochrome which
      really helped me a lot with understanding the values. Many times
      I will paint a value study first, but in this case I was a bit
      bemused by the painting, not sure where the midtone and darks
      were.

      In order to keep the very white values of the sun disc and the
      way it hits the edges of the clouds, I applied some masking fluid
      to preserve those white highlights.

      The very bright values in the sunset I put into a "bullseye"
      underpainting, using the very bright Qor paints I am using in
      this.

      This was super fun, using the deep tones I had in the Qor paints
      but still maintaining a gorgeous luster. The dry brush on the
      water was rather fun, though it was a new technique our teacher
      was showing for doing dry brush, and I didn't quite get it.

    caption: "Changing directions: extending the lake into the full foreground"
    description: >-
      The following week, coming back to this painting and removing
      the dried masking fluid, everyone felt I should take the
      painting in a different direction.

      The brilliant qualities of the clouds' edges needed to be
      balanced better in the foreground, so I decided to make the
      water of the lake completely fill the foreground so I could be
      reflections from the sky in the water, capitulating upper and
      lower halves.

      I decided to stick in a boat for semi-fun, since we were
      watching an Andy Evansen painting video where he is painting
      boats in Monterey Bay.

      The deep, bright tones in the water reflections will need to be added to the
      top sunset.

Our instructor promised us a really bright, colourful picture to
paint, and this sunset is just yummy.

## Thoughts

This piece is not finished, but I'm going to let it sit for awhile
before finishing it. I want to balance the intensity of the water
reflection with the actual sunset in the sky, and do something more
with the boat off to the left, althought not too much as it should
just be a silouhette.

As for using the Qor colours, they certainly do deliver on having
intense bright pigments. I think they'll find their way into more of
my paintings.
