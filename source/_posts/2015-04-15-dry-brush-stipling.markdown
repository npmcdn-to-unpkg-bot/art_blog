      Our teacher found this image and sent it out to us in the class
      in order to practice some dry brush stipling techniques as done
      by one of her teachers, Andy Evansen.

      After sketching in the scene in blue pencil, I painted on the
      middle tones of the picture.

      This was washed on with a 1-inch flat brush.

      When the middle tones had all dried, I applied some of the
      darkest tones, representing the "blacks" of the image.

      For the rest of the painting, I used my #10 Dreamcatcher.

      Not satisfied with the first pass on the darks, I ran a second
      wash of darks, covering more area. Most of the darks in the
      painting are in the foreground, both figuratively and literally
      grounding the painting.

      The technique we are learning to emulate is a stipling effect
      with a dry brush.

      Linda taught us the "pattern" used by Andy:

      1. Dip brush in water
      2. Pat twice on sponge
      3. Soak up juicy paint on whole bristle
      4. Pat once
      5. Apply with brush flat, holding the brush in an overhand mode

      The paint used here was initially DS Neutral Tint, then DS
      Prussian Blue.

      After playing with the paint, I thought the colour rather
      wonderful to use in a fountain pen, and wanted to have a swatch
      to compare against some ink.

      There is *something* about these monochrome value studies that I
      *really* like better than many of my colour paintings.

In class today, Linda showed us a technique used by one of her
teachers, [Andy Evansen][evansen], a dry brush stipling technique that
we used to acheive a nice feel with trees.

## Thoughts

The key thing to learn about Andy's technique is water
control. Oftentimes I have too much water on the brush, and this
technique "dip-in-water pat pat dip-in-paint pat" seems to take care of a lot of
that. One of the keys seems to also be using something more absorbant
than I had been using. A regular cellulose sponge (a bit damp) is what
Andy uses and what Linda had us using today. Mostly I have been using
a paper towel, which is pretty absorbant, too, but it's really the
*pattern* that seems to be most important, sort of like "wax on, wax
off". Repeating the pattern will burn it into muscle memory.

Another thing is using the dry brush technique. I so *love* this
effect which gives some guidance to the eye, but allows us to fill in
the details ourselves, which is pretty cool to have in a painting, and
is one of the things that really sets painting apart from photography,
I think.
