      The top of the board the rooster is standing on is mostly in a bluish cast, here I added in wood grain details for the top of the board, the facing side, and the background wood.

      Bird feet are kind of fascinating. This fellow's feet look rather scaley, and they aren't just solid white. There were oranges and blues mixed in here and there, but they still come off as predominantly white. I used a very fine brush (#1 round) to make the lines for the feet and the beak. I also dulled down the standing board quite a bit with first a light wash of French ultramarine blue and then, after that dried, a light wash of quin burnt orange.

      Along the way, I thought the back end of the bird's feathers started getting really muddy. I tried a few different things to bring back life. Finally, I got some "Halloween Orange" from my teacher and used the #4 round to apply it quite thickly in thin strokes, some dry, some more wet. I also applied more fresh cad red the same way.  I'm still not very happy with the result, it looks to muddy to me, but people in class liked it and the teacher said it was good.

More on our elegant rooster friend from [last week]({% post_url 2015-05-06-rooster-part-1 %}). This week was mostly putting in the background and details to finish the work. I don't consider this one so much "finished" though, as "abandoned". I'm done with this for now, putting it aside.

{% assign gallery_path = site.s3path | append: page.gallery.path %}

![]({{ page.gallery.images.last.web | prepend: gallery_path }})

I still see lots of problems with this. The back end of the bird got too muddy, I feel, and lost all it's brightness and glow. I'm quite unhappy with the background. Although I do like the dry brush effect I used, it seems dull. I had washed the background in the last few steps with quin gold to try to give it more "oomph", but it just isn't working.

What I'd love to try is to be more free-flowing, not spend so much time on it, and especially leave the background much, much simpler, if not omitted completely. I'm going to give this fellow another try sometime, because he is very wonderful, but not stick so much to the original photo.
