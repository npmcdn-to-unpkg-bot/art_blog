Work in progress on a painting in class: ![](http://tt.imageshare.s3.amazonaws.com/art/class/2014-11-boat-awesome-autumn-colour/web/20141112_145104.jpg)

## Source Image

This came from our teacher, which she found on the web
someplace. Rather a gorgeous picture.

I took the image and reduced it to greyscale, adjusting levels, and
reducing to 3 colours (Posterize filter) to achieve the equivalent of
a value study:

## Recomposition/Redesign

I'm changing this quite a bit for my painting. I'm keeping the boat,
but moving it to the left so the stern is out of picture. I'm also
changing the basic boat colour to the sort of green one sees on Old
Town canoes, though this is still a duck boat.

I'm adding in quite a bit of sky and reflection in the lake.

I'll be framing the boat with trees, and adding some trees to the far
shore, but not making it a small pond as in the source image.

Definitely going to keep the autumn colour going.

## Work in Progress

Here's the various stages of painting I did today:

## Colours

The boat bottom is a mixture of Daniel Smith (DS) Phthalo Green and DS
Permanent Alizerin Crimson. I'll be glazing over this to dull it down
a bit, especially as it will be in shadow compared to where the sun is
either setting or rising, I'm not sure yet. :)

The sky is a mix of Windsor-Newton (WN) French Ultramarine Blue and DS
Quinacrodone Burnt Orange, which elicits the lovely black I love so
much; here it is lightened up quite a bit, but with some darker
clouds. There is also the red of the sun(rise/set) in Permanent
Alizerin Crimson.

The water reflects the sun again in Permanent Alizerin Crimson and the
water is just French Ultramarine Blue.

## Paper

The paper is our class standard 140 pound cold press Arches paper, on
a 9x12 block.
