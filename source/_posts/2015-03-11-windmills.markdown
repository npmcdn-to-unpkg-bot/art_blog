        A very tiny image to start with, I blew it up a lot on the
        copier. Honestly, what you see in the thumbnail is about the
        actual size!

        There really isn't much to this picture, mostly the middle
        tones of the land and the windmills. The darkest parts are the
        vanes and the roofs.

        I love doing sky. This is cobalt blue.

        The base colours for the sky and ground in, I decided to go
        bright red for the mills. I'm not at all aware of the original
        colour for these mills, I just like the red. :)

        I love the richness of the tones here in the red. I used a
        mixture of permanent rose and quin burnt orange.

        This is basically how I want the colours to work, and the
        various elements, when I do the full size painting next
        week. I am loving this.

I started a new painting project this week. Linda passed around some
travel brochures, and I found a very tiny image of windmills that I
blew up in B&W on the copier.

I also reoriented the picture to landscape.

I'm pretty pleased with how this is coming. What I'm really pleased
with is actually doing the value study and colour study, and really
**looking** at what I'm doing and thinking about the painting, rather
than just diving in.

These went pretty fast today, about an hour total for both value and
colour study, which included a fair bit of drying time for the colour
study. (You can rather see where I was impatient at first.)
