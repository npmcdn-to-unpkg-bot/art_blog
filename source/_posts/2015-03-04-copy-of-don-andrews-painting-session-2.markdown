        Since most of the painting has a yellow quality to it, I
        painted most of the background in Aureolin (Cobalt Yellow)
        (Daniel Smith). I left some of the area that were not
        yellowish plain white.

        The next wash is the midtones. Even though these appear dark
        against the yellow, they are the middle tones in this
        painting.

        With this layer, I'm getting in the darkness that is in Don's
        original painting. These are blacks made of French Ultramarine
        Blue and Quin Burnt Orange, with a bit more blue.

      caption: "Adding colour"
      description: >-
        This is hugely important to this piece, as Don's sense of
        colour is just amazing. The pots, the shadow on the ground,
        the woman stepping through the doorway/portal.

Starting last week, our assignment was to work on a copy of a painting
by [Don Andrews](http://www.donandrews.net), an artist
[already familiar]({% post_url 2013-10-16-donandrews-dot-net %})
to us in class.

{% for image in page.gallery.images %}
{% include image_entry.html %}

I am actually really pleased with the painting at this stage. There is
still quite a bit of work to do to get it where I really want it, but
this is a good start for me.

I really wanted to go faster with this. I ended up spending a lot of
time waiting for things to dry, and then spent too much time on some
fiddly things.

Having done the thumbnail value study and colour study last week did
help tremendously though. I knew where I wanted things to go, and that
made a huge difference.

Don's work is **astounding**. Please go buy his stuff!
