I picked this up as an exercise in doing a figure, a portrait, which I'm none too practiced at.

This was also a practice in a two-colour, complementary colour scheme. Only using French Ultramarine Blue and Quin Burnt Orange, I had all the colours I needed for this painting.

The dog looks like a likely fellow. When I finished, my teacher remarked "Now there's trouble", so that's what I ended up naming the piece.

{% assign data = site.data[data] %}
{% assign gallery = data.gallery %}
{% assign materials = data.materials %}
{% assign gallery_path = site.s3path | append: gallery.path %}
{% assign images = gallery.images %}

{% include image_feature.html image=images.last %}

*******

## Steps

{% for image in images %}
{% include image_entry.html %}
{% endfor %}

## Materials
{% for material in materials %}
### {{ material.first }}
{% for item in material.last %}
* {{ item }}{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
