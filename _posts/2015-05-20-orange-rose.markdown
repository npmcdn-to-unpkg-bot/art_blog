      Beautiful source image of this rose, glowing orange and yellow, against this redish-purple backdrop.

      I used a very pale Aureolin (Cobalt Yellow) as the base colour for the entire flower petal arrangement to give it a nice glowing core.

      The orange, pinks, and peach tones were made by mixing Permanent Rose and New Gamboge in various ways, and applying some of each colour directly, very wet, very juicy.

      The next wash is more the same, in even purer values of Permanent Rose and New Gamoge, with some addtional pure Cobalt Red to give even more depth.

      The shading on the outer petals is a mixture of New Gamboge and very slight amount of Cobalt Blue Violet. I really like the effect here.

      The background is a mixture of Red and Red-Violet from my student Prang set. I haven't used these in quite some time, but they did a wonderful job here.

      The stem and leaves were done with a mixture of Sap Green and New Gamboge, and then edges with French Ultramarine Blue while still a bit wet. I'm really loving how this worked!

    caption: 'Remove masking, dulling some of the background'
    description: |-
      I removed the masking finally, to make the petal edges reappear. I also used some Sap Green and Permanent Rose to dull the lower background a bit. It could probably use a bit more of that.

      Finishing this up in one class period, I stretched out the background a bit more but keeping it lighter, to keep the main subject a bit more focused.

A lovely orange rose, simple and fun.

I very much enjoyed doing this, starting and finishing it in the class
time allotted. Lately I have been taking a lot longer with my
painting, and I know I do a better job if I go more quickly. Flowers
also seem a lot easier for me to get into than other subjects.

I'm very pleased with this, and won't be taking it any further.
