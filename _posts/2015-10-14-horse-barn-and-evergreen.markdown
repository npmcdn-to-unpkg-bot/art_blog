      This is sort of funny; I rarely ever have such an organized painting area, except right at the start of class.

      This was even a bit more organized than usual, as it all looks like right angles and such.

    description: |

      The original picture (which I don't seem to have an digital copy
      of) was poorly composed. Undaunted, we as artists stepped forth
      with the encouragement of our teacher and recomposed the picture
      to our liking.

    caption: "Fill in sky background"
    description: |

      After finally getting the drawing I liked, I traced it onto
      watercolour paper, and set about to fill in the sky.

      The sky in the original had a rather bland, uniform greyness to
      it, and we filled with trees. I used a mixture of french
      ultramarine, quin burnt orange and a bit of permanent rose to
      lay in the background, then went over dropping in some
      ultramarine and QBO mixture to streak in some clouds, then did a
      little feathering and softening.

    description: |

      I painted in the evergreen with a mix on the paper of phthalo
      green and french ultramaring, with dropping in some quin burnt
      orange loosely. While it was still quite wet, I started dropping
      in gouache. It may have still been too wet, and the gouache was
      too wet, because it just sort of got chalky and not snowy. I'm
      hoping next week to be able to make it appear more like snow.

      I started in on the horse next. Painting in most of the body
      with quin burnt gold, then adding quin burnt orange to that for
      more shading and texture.

      Too soon, I put in some ultramarine to give it some shading. I
      should have waited until the QBO and QG dried more.

    caption: Retry the snow on the evergreen with gouache
    description: |

      Last week's attempt at doing the snowy evergreen by dropping
      gouache into the wet paint didn't really work out, it just turned
      everything sort of milky, so I tried it again with just the
      gouache.

      I still was not happy with it, and found out why -- I've been
      using gouache I put into my paint palette that's all dried up. To
      do this properly, one must use *fresh* gouache, straight from the
      tube.

    description: |

      Okay, this is more like it!

      With fresh squeezed gouache, I was able to brush on the snow
      thicker.

      But a new problem emerged, again pointed out by Linda.

      I had been staring at the picture trying to figure out what was
      wrong with it, why I didn't like something about it. It turns out,
      that all the major objects are the same size, most especially the
      barn and horse. The tree might seem okay because it's upright, but
      I think they're all too close to the same size.

    description: |

      With Linda's advice in hand, I set to on the tree first, extending
      it all the way up to the top of the page, again using the
      Ph.Green, Fr.Ultra, and a bit of QBO. After it dried a bit, but
      not completely, I touched in the pure white gouache.

      Next, I extended the barn buildings a little bit. While working on
      them, I laid over some darker glaze, and then struck vertical
      lines for the barn boards using a palette knife.

      I used some more gouache for the snowy roof of the extra building
      as well.

    description: |

      This pair of trees I set in to make sure they get placed. There is
      more work to do on them. I'm pleased with them now, as far as the
      trunks and given a bit of white to appear a bit snowy.

    caption: Dried down
    description: |

      This was taken tonight after everything has had the time to dry
      down. I'm still quite pleased with how things are working on this
      painting.

      I still need to work on this, so far everything is completely
      disconnected and floating, it's like three different
      subjects. I'll need to connect them and unify the
      painting. Fences, shadows, contours in the snow, other more
      incidental vegetation, and so on.

      I do have to say I really like the way the horse is turning
      out. He's got a bit of life to him, even being rather completely
      sideways. When I put in the face details hopefully that will show
      his head turned more to face the viewer.

    caption: connecting the elements
    description: |

      All three of the major elements on the paper so far, the horse,
      the barn, and the tree, seem very separate, very disconnected,
      like 3 different paintings on the same page.

      It's important that the parts of the painting all connect, all
      interact and so the eye flows through the painting.

      Lifting some technique from one of my inspirations, Zoltan
      Szabo, I used pale Alizerin Crimson and French Ultramarine to
      make shadows in the snow and give it some curvations and
      texture, so it's not just one flat empty field.

      I really love the expression I got on the horse, with it's
      lovely eyelashes.

    description: |

      I really liked the way the connection above worked, but there
      needed some other bits as well. The nearby tree really needed a
      shadow to ground it, the horse needed something to be interested
      in, thus the grasses and vegetation, and just a few other bits
      helped round out the painting.

This started out with a black and white photocopy of an image that was
not composed particularly well. The exercise was to recompose it to
our own liking.

We started off by cutting up the original into it's main component parts:

* the evergreen tree
* the barn
* the horse

I decided I really wanted to make the horse the most prominent
feature, the key subject of the piece. I enlarged the original horse
by sketching around it, shifted the evergreen tree off to the left
even more, slimmed it down, and put the barn a wee bit more into the
upper part of the image, and moved the large tree in front of it off
to the left as well.
