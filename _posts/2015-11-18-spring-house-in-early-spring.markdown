    caption: Spring house -- and a happy mistake
    description: |


      The image of a spring house in the early spring was pretty
      interesting. We got to deal with snow and shadows.

      As I was painting the darker parts on the spring house using QBO
      and French Ultramarine, mixing them on the paper, I thought
      while I was in those colours, I'd start on the trees. I did the
      big tree on the right, and then realized I hadn't painted in the
      background beforehand.

      Without really thinking too much about it, I started to paint it
      in, trying to keep it from hitting the still-wet tree. Obviously
      that failed, but the tree started to take on this lovely fuzzy,
      etherial look that was really fascinating.

    caption: Exploiting the Happy Mistake
    description: |

      I painted in the other
      trees while the background was still wet.
      If you make a mistake, *make it again*.

      The painting is
      actually upside down because that's how I wanted the paint to
      flow. The tape is on the roofline to keep it white while
      painting in the sky.

      I *really* like the way this turned out.

    caption: Door, Wall, and Eave Shadow, and a not-so-happy mistake
    description: |


      The door was rather fun to do. It's the classic pallete mixture
      of QBO and Fr Ultramarine to a nice chromatic black. The shallow
      and deep shadows from the door boards were really fun to get
      right.

      I sketched in the mortor lines first with a number 2 pencil, and
      then added a bit more of the chromatic black on some of them, as
      there seemed deeper cracks in the mortor in some places. It have
      the wall a nice, rough look, of uneven stone.

      The foreground fence was really dark, since it is on the shadow
      side (the light source is hitting it from behind on the
      right). Meanwhile the fence across the back is in the sunlight
      so it's the same shade of raw sienna as the facing wall.

      The shadows from other trees in the front were put in using a
      rigger with Fr Ultra using a very swift casual stroke. I tried
      not to do too many.

      The deep shadow from the overhanging eave on the face of the
      spring house was quite important to the overall image, but here
      I've painted it in too far down the face of the wall.

    caption: Fixing the eave shadow part 1
    description: |

      The only thing for it was to remove it, and try to remove it
      *completely* from the painting, so I taped off the part I wanted
      to remove and scrubbed it out using the good old Magic Eraser,
      which does a pretty good job at removing paint that hasn't
      stained or seeped into the paper.

      It worked pretty well this time, and it was time to put this
      painting up and work on something else and pick it up next
      week.

    caption: Fixing the eave shadow part 2
    description: |

      Filling in the blank space was pretty easy after I remembered
      which paint I used (Raw Sienna) and at the proper shade. Doing
      the darker parts was also pretty easy, and I was able to get the
      hot spot on the front wall of the roof area a nice warm colour
      to attract the eye.

      This was fixed pretty well, though close inspection can reveal
      the traces of the former shadowed area.

    caption: Balance the Side Yards
    description: |

      The two side yards had vastly different treatments and colours,
      so I tried to balance them out.

    caption: Putting back some of the snow in the yards
    description: |

      After balancing the side yards, the open spaces I had for snow
      on the left were gone, so I got out some fresh gouache and
      stippled / stabbed it on as a paste.

      So this is the final, signed version of the painting. I really
      do like the way this turned out.

      This was modified in Photoshop to deal with levels, perspective,
      skew, and cropping out the surrounding bits from the photo.

      Mat added in Photoshop. I like adding it so I can try out
      different mat colours before I have to commit to one for
      hanging. This time, I sampled some of the QBO from one of the
      trees for the outer mat colour.

A spring house, in early spring (we think) with snow still on the ground,
but patchy.

{% assign gallery_path = site.s3path | append: page.gallery.path %}

![Spring House in Early Spring painting]({{ page.gallery.images.last.web | prepend: gallery_path }} "Spring HouseIn Early Spring")
{:.responsive-image-markdown}

This was done in a few different sessions. During the process there
was one quite happy accident that I further exploited and one outright
mistake that needed correction. The resulting painting I really quite
like.
