      4 calligraphy nibs, from 1.5 mm up to 6 mm! These are going to be ridiculously fun!

---

Yesterday, I received my latest drop from
[Goulet Pens](http://gouletpens.com) that included a set of 4
[Pilot Parallel Calligraphy Pens](http://www.gouletpens.com/package-parallel4/p/Package-Parallel4).

{% assign gallery_path = site.s3path | append: page.gallery.path %}

![]({{ page.gallery.images.last.web | prepend: gallery_path }})

These are all about the fun. They arrived yesterday, but this is
the first I've had a chance to pull them out and play with them,
and even then it's not really enough time.

I don't quite have anything in mind for them, but I saw them and
they're pretty inexpensive for a full set of calligraphy pens,
so why not, I thought, thought I.

The set has 4 nib widths, and they're ridiculously fat.

* 6.0 mm
* 3.8 mm
* 2.4 mm
* 1.5 mm

I need a **whole** lot of practice with these, slowing way, waaa-a-ay
down, ensuring angles and placement, posture, and all that fun stuff.

Also, holy-cow does looking at the cap colour make you think you're
using a specific colour ink --- that lovely green shade was coming out
of the pen with the orange cap (2.4 mm). This means I will need to
remember to test before applying ink! (A good thing to do anyway --
warmups are good stuff.)
