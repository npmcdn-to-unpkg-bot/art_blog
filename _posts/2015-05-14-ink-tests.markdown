      One of the results for me of playing with art supplies and stuff like this is that I tend to be a bit messy and get it on myself. This isn't so much of a problem with watercolour paints, but wow is it a problem with inks staining my fingers. :) Mind you, a problem I don't mind having!

      Another purchase I made was a Noodler's Konrad Brush pen. I love brush pens, aka japanese fude pens. This is using the lovely lovely Cactus Fruit Eel ink (Eel is a line on inks, I don't think it has anything to do with the creatures (I hope not). This is fun ink, I can see using this on projects.

      This is using the highly prized Apache Sunset ink from Noodler's. Many people have sworn by (not at) this ink and I can see why. It may not be so great as a straight-up writing ink, but the colour is absolutely gorgeous! I could see using this more as an ink wash, which I'm going to have to try sometime.

      I was using prussian blue in a recent watercolour painting test, and I think I started to really like the colour for itself. I bought a sample vial of Diamine Prussian Blue ink and gave it a whirl in the Ahab flex pen. I like this colour, I think I'm going to pop for a whole bottle and use it on a more regular basis.

The [Goulet Pen Company][goulet] keeps sending me
emails that I am compelled to read and then I have to go off and
purchase something else from them. This is turning into a bit of an
expensive hobby. :)

I recently bought a set of ink samples from them, and started to play
around a bit. Naturally, this resulted in ink-stained fingers. :)

Here's a few samples.

## Thoughts

This is becoming quite a hobby. I have always loved art and office
supplies, sort of an obsession, really, and can spend hours in office
& art supply stores.

Somewhere someone recommended a cheap fountain pen for sketching, and
I discovered [Goulet Pens][goulet] for myself. Listening to their
podcasts, videocasts, reading their blog, it's all so fun and new and
shiny and ...

Yeah.

The inks are fun; I have a whole bunch to eventually try out. Cleaning
and filling the pens can be a bit of a pain for testing inks, though,
so I just ordered (*cough*) a glass pen that will let me just dip ink
out of the tiny sample vials. Looking forward to that.

### Flex pen

The [Ahab flex pen][ahab] is something that is quite new to me. I had
not heard of these before, but it became clear I had to have one. The
nib is flexible (hence the name) and it allows you to create a more
italic/calligraphic style of writing by applying more pressure on
downward strokes of the pen. It will definitely take me some practice
time to get used to it. Nevertheless, I am pleased with the results on
it.

The Ahab comes completely apart, which is interesting. Putting
everything back together proved to be a bit of a challenge for me,
though. I needed to close down the plunger slightly in order to screw
the barrel back on, and I didn't remember seeing that that was
necessary when I took it apart. There was also a bit more ink around
the collar than I expected, and it partly leaked out. I think I
eventually got things under control, but the semi-depressed plunger is
a bit disturbing.

### Brush pen

The [Konrad brush pen][brush] is also fun. I've had several fude pens
from Japan in the past few years, and have been studying Japanese
Sumi-e painting techniques, and this is quite a win for me, having a
fillable brush pen. (My others have replacement cartridges, but only
black ink.)
