      caption: "First Wash - Lightest"
      description: >-
        The first wash applied is the base colours, underpainting, the
        lightest shades in the painting. This was only the first part
        of the underpainting, I continued the light washes further
        down the paper, repeating the colours in the opposite
        order. Colours used were Cobalt Blue, Permanent Rose, and
        Aureolin from top to the middle of the page, then continuing
        down with Perm. Rose and a much lighter shade of Cobalt Blue.

      caption: "Practice - middle tones"
      description: >-
        This was a small practice piece for getting the right pigment
        density for the middle tones. These go on really juicy, and
        blend together. This is the part of watercolour I just love,
        watching the paint move and mingle. Four colours were actually
        used here, two blues (Cobalt Blue and French Ultramarine) and
        two reds (Permanent Rose and Rose Madder Genuine). I tried to
        take a video to watch the colours blend, but they just didn't
        work out.

      caption: "Second wash - Middle Tones"
      description: >-
        Nearly everything is covered, saving the lightest areas, in
        this case where the Sun is bearing directly on the sides of
        the buildings and the foreground. Using the 4 colours from the
        practice piece, Cobalt Blue, French Ultramarine Blue,
        Permanent Rose, and Rose Madder Genuine, keeping them really
        wet and juicy. When I originally had them on the paper, I
        wasn't so impressed with what I'd done, but once they'd dried
        down, I began to enjoy what came out.

      caption: "Final wash - darks"
      description: |-
        The last wash is the darks, the trees in the background, the
        details on the buildings, etc.  The colours used here (so far)
        are Quin Burnt Orange and French Ultramarine Blue, applied
        directly to and mixed on the paper, rather than mixed in the
        palette.

        This is where the painting's details come in, and I can start
        to see the buildings for what they are.  Notice the tree to
        the left of the house is still quite wet.

Our instructor, Linda, is taking a workshop from one of her favourite
artists, [Andy Evansen](http://www.evansenartstudio.com/), who is a
local Minnesota painter. We in class really love his style, which is
so loose and full.

His painting technique consists of 3 washes: lights, middles, and
darks. He paints with very "juicy" paint, wet but full of pigment.

## Thoughts

I really enjoyed doing this exercise. I may or may not actually
complete it, but I think I've discovered a style of painting I
like. Similar to working in the style of other artists, Don Andrews,
Zoltan Szabo, Faeling Lin, others, I've learned so much, and had so
much fun.

This is what it's all about for me. :)
