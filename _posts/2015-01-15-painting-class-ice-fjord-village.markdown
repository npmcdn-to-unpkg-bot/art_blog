First project of 2015 in painting class has been a rendition of
&Ouml;rvar Atli's picture ["Ice Fjord Village"]({{ page.source }}).

We had done a similar picture as an exercise in receeding values into
the distance, but this particular image really caught my eye.

## Original:

## Class work, day 1: 2015-01-07

### Sky

![]({{ page.day1.sky | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Getting the sky was a key element for this picture. I was hoping to
have something redder to match the photograph, but I'm okay with
this. I dripped some paint and tried to wipe it off in the yellow
area, and did it to try and make it work with the sunbeams that are
coming down.

It wasn't great, but I think it's okay.

### Sunbeams

![]({{ page.day1.sky_and_sunbeam | prepend: site.baseurl }})

I didn't know exactly how I was going to manage the sunbeams, but
Linda showed me a technique:

1. Using masking tape, mask out the area for where the sunbeam will
go.

2. Wet the area inside the tape thoroughly, let it soak a bit.

3. Using a Magic Eraser @trade;, *gently* erase and lift the
paint. Blot dry.

## Class work, day 2: 2015-01-14

### More sunbeams and underpainting

![]({{ page.day2.land_underpainting | prepend: site.baseurl }})

I made a bunch more sunbeams like last week, spreading them out and
capturing the ones that emerge from behind the clouds. I also scrubbed
out a general area where the most light would come from the sun.

I started the underpainting of the mid-ground landscape, starting
light but trying to capture the tones of the ground.

### Midground land underpainting

![]({{ page.day2.midground_land_underpainting | prepend: site.baseurl }})

There's this promontory that extends out in the midground, and I
wanted a nice vegetation underpainting going there before I laid in
the heavier values. I like the way this went.

### Land overpainting

![]({{ page.day2.land_overpainting | prepend: site.baseurl }})

I laid in deeper values using sap green and quin burnt orange. I like
the way this turned out.

### Water

![]({{ page.day2.water | prepend: site.baseurl }})

The water seemed like it was going to be tricky. In the source, the
water is this silvery metallic, obviously *very* cold stuff, with the
ice bergs floating in it.

I first masked off the ice bergs, then made a mixture of cobalt blue
and quin burnt orange to grey it down, and applied it lightly. As it
was going in, I added some more cobalt blue in areas.

It doesn't look anywhere near as cold as the source, unfortunately.

### Foreground and distance

![]({{ page.day2.foreground_and_distance | prepend: site.baseurl }})

The granite foreground was interesting; I used basically the same
formula of cobalt blue and quin burnt orange, but increased the amount
of oranage to grey it out even more. I had applied mask here as well
to keep some areas of the granite white.

I then applied a bit of the same to the land in the far distance. I
think it balances pretty well.


## Home work, 2015-01-15

Picking up work again at home because I didn't want to leave the
masking fluid on the paper too long, lest it dry and pull up the
paper. (This has been happening lately with Arches. We don't know
why.)

### Houses

![]({{ page.home1.houses | prepend: site.baseurl }})

I had applied masking fluid to some of the house details as well
(windows and doors and such) because they were such a strong highlight
in the source.

I underpainted some areas of the houses with a mixture of quin gold
and quin burnt scarlet, and then other areas with a mixture of sap
green and quin burnt orange.

Then I painted over all of that with a glaze of quin burnt orange and
french ultramarine blue.

I initially had envisioned the roofs of the houses in brown, but
they're really more of a slate.

Using prussian blue and cobalt red, I made a dark slate grey-black and
applied it fairly thick. I used the same for the vertical slats.

Then I pulled off all the masking fluid and *no tears!*

## Forward

I'm actually pretty pleased with this as it is going. I need to add
more detail to the ice bergs, give them some three-dimensionality and
such. I might also tone down the slats in the houses; they should be
less stark, more weathered. It might be difficult now, though, as I've
taken the masking fluid off and I don't want to lose the windows and
doors.
