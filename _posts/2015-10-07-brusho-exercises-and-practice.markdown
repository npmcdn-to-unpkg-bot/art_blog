    description: |-
      Sprinkled Alizerin Crimson to the same paper. Then spritzed water on them both.

    description: |-
      Sprayed a lot more water on the previous (notice how the paper really curls up)

    caption: 'Blending: more water on turquoise and alizerin crimson'
    description: |-
      Added more water here with the spritzer to see how the crystals would run and meld.

      Gently spray with the water spritzer. I probably made it too wet here.

    description: |-
      Step 2 - Wet the inside of the apple shape.

      Step 3 - Sprinkle a little Yellow and Brilliant Red onto the wet paper.

      Step 4 - Watch it spread (OMG IS THIS SOOOO COOL)

      Step 5 - Take a regular clean brush, wet it and gently move the pigment around with only a couple strokes.

    description: |-
      Step 2 - Sprinkle Yellow and Scarlet all over apple shape and beyond a bit.

      Step 3 - Take clear brush and move the pigment around - don't rub too much and let the colours blend.

    description: |-
      Step 4 - Put some Ultramarine in your palette and add a drop of water.

      Step 5 - Apply the Ultramarine to the bottom and to the right on the apple shape while the Yellow and Scarlett are still wet. (By the time the crystals got to me, I think it was already too late and the Yellow and Scarlett were too dry.)

      Step 6 - While painting the shadow onto the apple, extend the shadow shape to the right onto the imaginary table.

    caption: 'A drop of water in the sea green crystal powder'
    description: |-
      The way the crystals take up water is really fascinating; the dry crystal colour isn't what it's going to look like when it's wet.

      Step 4 - let the painting dry.

      Step 5 - Wet the area behind the apple ont the top left and paint behind the apple with Ultramarine. Note my painting is upside down because I was letting the Ultramarine flow away from the apple to fade out.

      Step 6 - Paint shadow on the right under the apple.

    caption: 'Exercises: Apple 2, steps 7 and 8'
    description: |-
      Step 7 - add some Light Brown to your palette and a drop of water. (I think I added too much water to the crystals - or not enough crystals to water.)

      Step 8 - Indicate a table with some of the Brown mixture to the left of the apple.

    description: |-
      Step 6 - let dry

      Step 7 - Wet paper on the top left and paint behind the apple with Ultramaring and fade out. (Again, it's upside down.)

    caption: 'Exercises: Apple 3, step 8'
    description: |-
      Step 8 - Add a shadow on the right in Ultramarine.

      I also did added the Light Brown to indicate a table.

      What I didn't do for any of the apples was give them a stem or leave a little white highlight on the lit side.

    caption: 'Exercises: Apple 4, steps 7 through 10'
    description: |-
      Step 7 - Let dry.

      Step 8 - Wet paper behind the apple on the top left with Ultramarine and fade it out. At this step I noticed something very amazing happening. As I laid in the Ultramarine, it started *repulsing* the other two colours, which had been picked up while wetting the area.

      Steps 9 and 10 not really shown here -- basically adding the table on the bottom right.

    description: |-
      Step 11 - Dry completely.

      Step 12 - Wet a small *OLD* brush and then dip it in the bleach. Make a small mark on the left of the apple shape.

      Step 13 - Rinse the old brush thoroughly and then use it to soften the edges of the bleach highlight.

      This was a really cool thing to see; the bleach didn't show immediately, but slowly you could see the paint disappear, leaving a really nice highlight.

      This wasn't part of the instructions for apple 3, but I did the same thing with the bleach here as in the previous part.

      This is the same painting as above, but a little bit more time. The bleach spot retained some of the yellow colour.

      This is the same sprinkle test from above, but now the paint has dried.

    caption: 'Exercises: Apple 1, end state'
    description: |-
      The apple 1 exercise was actually left to last; in this one we just mixed up the emerald green and painted with it as a regular paint, to show we could just to that. The highlight in this one is natural, just the white paper.

This time in class, we took up the Brusho crystal colours in a little
more earnest. The teacher led us through a set of exercises
(ostensibly the same subject, an apple on the table). We tried
applying the crystals dry and spraying after, wetting the area and
sprinkling the crystals in, painting wet into dry, and wet into wet.

The class was much fun, and I think several of us are going to add
this to our kit.
