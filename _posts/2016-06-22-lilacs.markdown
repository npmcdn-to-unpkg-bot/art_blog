This entry consists of two paintings of the same subject. The one on
the left took a lot of time and attention. The one on the right was
initially done in about 10 minutes.

{% if page.data %}{% assign data = page.data %}
{% else %}
{% assign data = page.path | split:"/" | last | split:"." | first %}
{% endif %}
{% assign data = site.data[data] %}
{% assign gallery = data.gallery %}
{% assign materials = data.materials %}
{% assign gallery_path = site.s3path | append: gallery.path %}
{% assign images = gallery.images %}

{% include image_feature.html image=images.last %}

I like both paintings, but the 10 minute painting has a better "feel"
to me. I love the fast and loose, more naturalistic style. The
painting I spent more time working on had several problems, some of
which I don't feel are resolved still.
