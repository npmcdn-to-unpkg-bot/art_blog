There was a slight mix-up in my October ink drop: an extra vial of
Heart of Darkness was in a vial labeled "Noodler's Nightshade". I
liked the Nightshade, so I ordered a bottle.  When it arrived, it
looked quite different. After a few emails back and forth, we figured
out what was mislabeled.

The Goulet's were awfully nice and sent me two vials of the HoD (which
was backordered at the time) and threw in two *more* vials: one of
Onyx Black (which I already own and love) and one of Private Reserve
Black Magic Blue.

Awfully sweet, those Goulet's (hat tip to Ross at GP Customer Service!
well done!).
