      The first stage of the painting is putting in the individual flowers. This was a lot of fine work, but still a lot of fun.

      Doing all the masking was also very painstaking work, a lot of fine detail with the liquid mask, which is kind of hard to work with. It doesn't flow at all, and it is really hard to get a fine line with it.

      This is, for me at least, the usual thing that happens with mask. There is more covered space than I originally intended. Still, I'm pleased with how the overall painting is coming along.

      Going back over the extra white areas that were covered with mask now to fill them in, connect the painting elements together and not leave anything done.

      I'm really pleased with how this turned out. Only particular objections I have is that it's mainly the same value (level of dark/medium/light) and probably would have more interest had that varied more.

      I squared up the picture of the painting in Photoshop as well.

      There was a shadow on the final shot previously, so I retook it with better lighting. There is nothing different about the painting, just a better photo. :)

This is a copy of a painting (who I cannot remember right now -- remember to find out next week in class) from one of her books.

It is supposed to give a *trompe l'oeil* impression that the flowers are both inside *and* outside the frame, but I kind of botched that up and all the flowers appear in front of the frame.

Still, I'm pretty pleased with how things worked out with it.

**Update:** The final shot I took in class had a shadow on it, so I reshot it with much better lighting and added the mat again in PS.
