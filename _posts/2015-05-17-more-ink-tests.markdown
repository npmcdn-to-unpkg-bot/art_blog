      A darker purple than I will probably want to use, but still a very lovely ink and colour.

      This was pretty interesting. A glass pen is a type of dip pen, and seems perfect really for testing various inks. It held more ink than I expected, but also changed the way I write.

    caption: 'Three types of red ink'
    description: |-
      I wanted to use a reddish ink in one of my Platinum Carbon Black Desk Pens, so I just tried each of them with the glass pen to see how they looked. The Oxblood looked reddish in the vial, but came out quite black on the paper. The Red Dragon was a bit lighter in the vial, but still came out darker than I was hoping for. Finally, the Noodler's Rattler's Red Eel ink was what I was looking for in a red ink for the extra fine nib in the Platinum pen. This should be fun.

      The Noodler's Rattler's Red Eel ink in the Platinum Carbon Black desk pen is really fun, like I thought it would be.

      Yet another Noodler's ink, Liberty's Elysium, is not in the Eel line, but it's really a fabulous ink. This went into my other new Platinum C.B. Desk pen, making 3!
