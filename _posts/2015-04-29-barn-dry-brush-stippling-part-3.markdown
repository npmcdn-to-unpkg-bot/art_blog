      This is the actual use of the "dry-brush stippling" technique
      this painting is supposed to be about learning.

      I'm not super happy with it yet, but I think it's going to work
      out fine. The source image was mostly all gold, I used quin gold,
      quin scarlet, and raw sienna for the leaves. I added some darker
      colour behind the barn to help it pop out, but it ended up too
      muddy. I still have to put in the tree trunks behind the barn to
      make it work.

      In the darker areas that represent shadow, I glazing over those
      sections with a reddish violet made from Perm. Alizerin Crimson
      and French Ultramarine Blue. I still have more work to do no this.

      In the lighter green areas, I wanted more yellow, so I ended up
      glazing those areas with Quin Gold, which I feel worked to good
      effect.

This is the 3rd session (
[part 1]({% post_url 2015-04-15-dry-brush-stipling %}) and
[part 2]({% post_url 2015-04-22-barn-dry-brush-stippling-part-2 %}))
working on this
painting, although most of the
class time was actually spent in exercises making little figures that
would go in some of our earler landscape painting, helping give a
human scale to the painting. I practiced just pencil sketching advance
stick figures and star-people.
