On a trip to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, in 2008, my friends and I
took a day trip down to Philip's Bay to visit the Faerie Penguins,
Koalas, and generally have a great drive.

This pier was along the road at one point, and I'm pretty sure I just
snapped this out the window as we were speeding by. (Aussie's drive on
the left.)

I entered this is a show once, but was not selected.
