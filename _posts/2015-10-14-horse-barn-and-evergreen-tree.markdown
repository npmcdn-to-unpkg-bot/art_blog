      This is sort of funny; I rarely ever have such an organized
      painting area, except right at the start of class. The painting
      on the block is the one I was working on a couple weeks ago,
      still not finished.

      This was even a bit more organized than usual, as it all looks like right angles and such.

      The original picture (which I don't seem to have an digital copy
      of) was poorly composed. Undaunted, we as artists stepped forth
      with the encouragement of our teacher and recomposed the picture
      to our liking.

    description: >-

      After finally getting the drawing I liked, I traced it onto watercolour paper, and set about to fill in the sky.

      The sky in the original had a rather bland, uniform greyness to
      it, and we filled with trees. I used a mixture of french
      ultramarine, quin burnt orange and a bit of permanent rose to
      lay in the background, then went over dropping in some
      ultramarine and QBO mixture to streak in some clouds, then did a
      little feathering and softening.

      I painted in the evergreen with a mix on the paper of phthalo
      green and french ultramaring, with dropping in some quin burnt
      orange loosely. While it was still quite wet, I started dropping
      in gouache. It may have still been too wet, and the gouache was
      too wet, because it just sort of got chalky and not snowy. I'm
      hoping next week to be able to make it appear more like snow.

      I started in on the horse next. Painting in most of the body
      with quin burnt gold, then adding quin burnt orange to that for
      more shading and texture.

      Too soon, I put in some ultramarine to give it some shading. I
      should have waited until the QBO and QG dried more.

This painting let us exercise our re-composition abilities. The
original image was a rather poor composition showing a Very Large tree
on the left of the image taking almost entirely the left half of the
paper. The barn was tucked behind a snow bank, and was a bit hard to
see. The horse was very small in the middle distance. Overall just not
a pleasing comp.

{% assign gallery_path = site.s3path | append: page.gallery.path %}

![]({{ page.gallery.images.last.web | prepend: gallery_path }})

Initially, we cut out the main objects from a photocopy and rearranged
them to our liking using the 3x3 grid. I decided I wanted to make the
horse the main focus and pulled it into the foreground, enlarging it
quite a bit. I also moved and narrowed the evergreen tree to make it
more balanced.

This painting is still a work in progress, and hopefully will get
finished next week. Depending on how it turns out, this might be my
winter holiday card.
