      This is sort of funny; I rarely ever have such an organized
      painting area, except right at the start of class. The painting
      on the block is the one I was working on a couple weeks ago,
      still not finished.

      This was even a bit more organized than usual, as it all looks like right angles and such.

    description: |

      The original picture (which I don't seem to have an digital copy
      of) was poorly composed. Undaunted, we as artists stepped forth
      with the encouragement of our teacher and recomposed the picture
      to our liking.

    description: |

      After finally getting the drawing I liked, I traced it onto watercolour paper, and set about to fill in the sky.

      The sky in the original had a rather bland, uniform greyness to
      it, and we filled with trees. I used a mixture of french
      ultramarine, quin burnt orange and a bit of permanent rose to
      lay in the background, then went over dropping in some
      ultramarine and QBO mixture to streak in some clouds, then did a
      little feathering and softening.

      I painted in the evergreen with a mix on the paper of phthalo
      green and french ultramaring, with dropping in some quin burnt
      orange loosely. While it was still quite wet, I started dropping
      in gouache. It may have still been too wet, and the gouache was
      too wet, because it just sort of got chalky and not snowy. I'm
      hoping next week to be able to make it appear more like snow.

      I started in on the horse next. Painting in most of the body
      with quin burnt gold, then adding quin burnt orange to that for
      more shading and texture.

      Too soon, I put in some ultramarine to give it some shading. I
      should have waited until the QBO and QG dried more.

    caption: 'Retry the snow on the evergreen with gouache'
    description: |

      Last week's attempt at doing the snowy evergreen by dropping
      gouache into the wet paint didn't really work out, it just turned
      everything sort of milky, so I tried it again with just the
      gouache.

      I still was not happy with it, and found out why -- I've been
      using gouache I put into my paint palette that's all dried up. To
      do this properly, one must use *fresh* gouache, straight from the
      tube.

      Okay, this is more like it!

      With fresh squeezed gouache, I was able to brush on the snow
      thicker.

      But a new problem emerged, again pointed out by Linda.

      I had been staring at the picture trying to figure out what was
      wrong with it, why I didn't like something about it. It turns out,
      that all the major objects are the same size, most especially the
      barn and horse. The tree might seem okay because it's upright, but
      I think they're all too close to the same size.

    description: |

      With Linda's advice in hand, I set to on the tree first, extending
      it all the way up to the top of the page, again using the
      Ph.Green, Fr.Ultra, and a bit of QBO. After it dried a bit, but
      not completely, I touched in the pure white gouache.

      Next, I extended the barn buildings a little bit. While working on
      them, I laid over some darker glaze, and then struck vertical
      lines for the barn boards using a palette knife.

      I used some more gouache for the snowy roof of the extra building
      as well.

      This pair of trees I set in to make sure they get placed. There is
      more work to do on them. I'm pleased with them now, as far as the
      trunks and given a bit of white to appear a bit snowy.

    caption: 'Dried down'
    description: |

      This was taken tonight after everything has had the time to dry
      down. I'm still quite pleased with how things are working on this
      painting.

      I still need to work on this, so far everything is completely
      disconnected and floating, it's like three different
      subjects. I'll need to connect them and unify the
      painting. Fences, shadows, contours in the snow, other more
      incidental vegetation, and so on.


      I do have to say I really like the way the horse is turning
      out. He's got a bit of life to him, even being rather completely
      sideways. When I put in the face details hopefully that will show
      his head turned more to face the viewer.

This painting let us exercise our re-composition abilities. The
original image was a rather poor composition showing a Very Large tree
on the left of the image taking almost entirely the left half of the
paper. The barn was tucked behind a snow bank, and was a bit hard to
see. The horse was very small in the middle distance. Overall just not
a pleasing comp.

{% assign gallery_path = site.s3path | append: page.gallery.path %}

![]({{ page.gallery.images.last.web | prepend: gallery_path }})

Initially, we cut out the main objects from a photocopy and rearranged
them to our liking using the 3x3 grid. I decided I wanted to make the
horse the main focus and pulled it into the foreground, enlarging it
quite a bit. I also moved and narrowed the evergreen tree to make it
more balanced.

This painting is still a work in progress, and hopefully will get
finished next week. Depending on how it turns out, this might be my
winter holiday card.

**Updated Oct 21 2015**

More work on this in class today. I learned a bunch of new things.

1. Gouache needs to be absolutely fresh to use the "drop-in snow"
   technique effectively. This made the tree look a *lot* more snowy.

2. You shouldn't have all the objects in the painting the same
   size. They need to be different enough to give the painting
   interest.

3. It's a great idea to step outside with your camera and take
   pictures of the astounding fall colours and brilliant sky when you
   have to wait for the painting to dry.

There is still a bunch more I need to do on this painting.
