      Just practicing some alphabets to get the feel of the ink.

      I rather like it.

      Obviously my lettering needs a lot of work. ((SLOW DOWN, MOUSIE!))

      Trying some dry-down tests. It's a bit wet, as noted.
      Probably not the first choice for lefties or rapid scribbling.
      Still, I had it along while grocery shopping to mark the list and it
      didn't get messy at all.

      Trying it out a bit with some random sketches, bunny faces and mouths.

      After having a *devil* of a time getting some other pens clean to use,
      I finally got another preppy loaded up with Black Magic Blue.

      It's a beautiful ink, really, quite deep blue, not subtle at all.
      It flows rather nicely with a fine nib on the preppy.
      I think this would make a lovely stationary ink.

      I cleaned out the Ahab flex pen before I put it away last time,
      thank heavens, as it took the Noodler's Nightshade quite nicely.

      This is also a pretty good ink, I don't have a lot of experience
      with different inks. I like the Diamine Onyx Black better than
      this, but this is still rather nice.

      Yes, sometimes I forget how to spell, especially when
      I am thinking more about the shape of the letters
      than about the letters. :D

      Again with the Noodler's Nightshade in the Ahab pen.

      Just a bit of practice, and as you can tell I'm in
      dire need of it! This is one of my favourite bits of the Bard,
      and seems so particularly apropriate in this political
      season.

I just signed up for the Goulet's [Ink Drop](http://www.gouletpens.com/ink-drop-membership-ongoing-subscription/p/InkDrop-Ongoing) monthly shipment of 5 sample inks.

Giving them a first look, I put the DeAtramentis Fog Grey in a spare Preppy I have and have been
giving it a good go. I really like this ink, it is a definite departure from the Diamine Onyx Black I've been
loving in my Metropolitan.

Realizing I've already missed out on the discount price for the bottle, I'll
probably let this one sit after I use it up.
