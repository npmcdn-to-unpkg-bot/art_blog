      Just practicing some alphabets to get the feel of the ink.

      I rather like it.

      Obviously my lettering needs a lot of work. ((SLOW DOWN, MOUSIE!))

      Trying some dry-down tests. It's a bit wet, as noted.
      Probably not the first choice for lefties or rapid scribbling.
      Still, I had it along while grocery shopping to mark the list and it
      didn't get messy at all.

      Trying it out a bit with some random sketches, bunny faces and mouths.

I just signed up for the Goulet's [Ink Drop](http://www.gouletpens.com/ink-drop-membership-ongoing-subscription/p/InkDrop-Ongoing) monthly shipment of 5 sample inks.

Giving them a first look, I put the DeAtramentis Fog Grey in a spare Preppy I have and have been
giving it a good go. I really like this ink, it is a definite departure from the Diamine Onyx Black I've been
loving in my Metropolitan.

Realizing I've already missed out on the discount price for the bottle, I'll
probably let this one sit after I use it up.
