      Super great picture we're copying to get the technique of his rocks and the scraping trick he does for the trees in this painting.

      After tracking in the basic features, the rocks, the ground, a couple trees, I painted in the sky using a light wash of Cobalt Blue.

      The background on this is quite interesting; there isn't really much of anything super distinct about it at first. That comes in the next step.

    caption: "Scraping out the tree trunks"
    description: |-
      This had gotten super saturated with paint and water, so I felt I had to wait a long time for it to dry. I then tried using a hair dryer, but then it became *too* dry to use the scraping technique. By using a credit card as a straight edge, line up the edge against one side of the tree trunk and scrape towards you across the tree. (Orienting the paper vertically, the edge is horizontal against the trunk, and it is pulled down about a quarter or half an inch.

      The technique did not work quite as planned, as you can see. I expected more to come off, but it had already soaked deep into the paper, and blowing drying it didn't help.

      The other very interesting part of this painting are the rock shadows.

      This shows the largest, furthest back rock with a lavender shadow that outlines and defines the rock in front of it.

      Continuing to paint in more rock shadows, giving more interest and so on.

    caption: "Tree trunks defined"
    description: |-
      This was done the following week. To get the tree trunks much more defined, I used masking tape for the trunks and very large branches. Using a soaked bit of magic eraser, I was able to very effectively remove the paint from the trunks, leaving some for texture and colour.

      Then I filled in the foreground, which was sort of a sandy brown.

      Finally, I put in the sweeping grasses. A few of the grasses on the left extended above the ground line. Looking closely at Tony Couch's original, I copied the concept that the grasses below the ground line were in color, above the ground line were white. For this I used the same taping and erasing technique.

      Lastly, painting in the tree branches.

      I *really* love the way the background paint dried out giving a very brush or fuzzy effect for the foliage.

      I am pretty happy with the result, though it took a bit more to get to it. I admire Tony so much and his painting is such an astounding inspiration.

Our teacher is always looking for ways to stretch us, and Tony Couch is one of our favourite painters. His technique of scraping is one that is unusual and effective.
