In a recent mailing from
[The Artists Network](http://www.artistsnetwork.com/) came an article
on
["How to Protect Areas of Your WIP Paintings"]({{page.source}}). The
author uses a combination of grocery store celophane and rubber cement
to cover large and precise area of his works in progress that might
receive washes and floods of paint. It's an interesting read.
