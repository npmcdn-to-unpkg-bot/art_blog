      description: >-
        After tracing out the shapes in a photo blue pencil, I put in
        the sky using cobalt blue with a 1 inch flat brush. I love
        using this brush for washes, it holds a *ton* of water. The
        water in the canal was next, using french ultramarine blue,
        also with the 1 inch flat.

        When the sky and water were (mostly) dry, I put in the grassy
        areas in the foreground and the middle area where the
        windmills are sitting. The base wash in each case was a
        mixture of sap green and aureolin (cobalt yellow). In the
        foreground I gave a little more depth with some phthalo green
        and quin burnt orange.

      caption: "Windmill towers base colour"
      description: >-
        The windmills hold the most interest, and the most colour, so
        I gave them a saturated red mixture of permanent alizerin
        crimson and quin burnt scarlett. I also wanted to show
        distance so the saturation trails off towards the right for
        the further windmills.

      caption: "Giving the windmills a sunny side"
      description: >-
        After waiting for everything to dry, I wanted to provide some
        clues as to where the sun was coming from.
        To my mind, the sun is coming from behind the mills on their
        left, so to given them a bit more 3-dimensionality, I put a
        bright refelction on their left side using white goache,
        applied heavily at first and tapering off.

      caption: "Darks and details"
      description: >-
        After waiting for everything to dry again, I put in the very
        darkest parts of the painting and some details on the
        mills. The roofs of the mills, the lines, the windows, the
        doors, are all in a chromatic black made of french ultramarine
        blue and quin burnt orange, using a \#4 round brush. Also,
        using the same chromatic black I put in the shadowy darker
        side of the mill towers, feathering it out to the left, again
        to give depth and 3 dimensionality.

      caption: "Vanes, docks, bridges, shadows, details"
      description: >-
        This is the final step in the painting, where I added the wind
        vanes which in the source photo were all in the same
        configuration - assuming these were all locked down. I like
        the symmetry this gives the painting as well. Further details
        included a couple of docks in the first two, shadows and
        reflections of the mills in the canal, and a dock on the near
        side.

        This is the final version of the painting, along with both the
        value study and the colour thumbnail. I like this version, and
        will be entering it in this year's state fair.

*******

I am pleased with the results I got on this picture. Doing the value
study and thumbnail colour study the previous week made a difference
for me, I think. I was ready to paint this.

I thought it would have gone faster, but there was considerable amount
of time waiting for previous steps to dry before beginning the next
step. This was fine, I think, and I got to putter about looking at
other classmates work while I waited.

I am going to enter this painting in this year's State Fair, not
because I think it will get in, but because it's basically all my own
work, getting no real help from the teacher save for the suggestion to
use goache for making the sunny side of the mills.
