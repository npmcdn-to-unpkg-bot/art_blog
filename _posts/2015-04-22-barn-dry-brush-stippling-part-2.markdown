    caption: 'Sky'
    description: |-
      The sky in the source photo (see last week's post) was not just
      your usual cerulean blue. It was a bit more turbulent, some grey,
      some blue, some purple, some clouds.

      I went for a more dramatic sky, which is something I just adore
      doing. Using cobalt blue, cobalt blue violet, french ultramarine
      blue and a touch of permanent alizerin crimson, washing, mixing
      wet on the paper, dabbing, overpainting, and I got a fairly nice
      effect, I feel.

      Another shot of the same stage, a little more in focus, and a little more uniform in lighting.

    caption: 'Base foreground colour: Gold'
    description: |-
      The foreground has a bright yellow feel to it, so I did the foreground underpainting in Quin Gold, which is a very bright, lively yellow tone.

    caption: 'Glazing over foreground in Yellow-Green'
    description: |-
      After the foreground dried completely, I used a pallete mixture of Sap Green and Cadmium Yellow Deep to give it a rather nice grassy colour in direct sunlight.

    caption: 'Deepening shadows in the foreground'
    description: |-
      The sun is directed from the left side of the page, the shadows falling from left to right. Something is casting the shadows, we don't know what, but can surmise it to be a line of trees.

      This area will need a bunch more work, I feel.

    caption: 'Tree bones'
    description: |-
      This is just the bones of the larger, more prominent trees.

      Using french ultramarine blue and quin burnt orange, I painted in the tree trunks, alternating and blending the colours directly on the page, using a number 4 round brush. This might be one of my favourite things to paint besides skies.

This is the colour version of the painting I started last week (See
[Dry Brush Stippling]({% post_url 2015-04-15-dry-brush-stipling %})).


I was worried it wouldn't end up as good as the value study, but I'm
liking it so far.
